# Introduction

Codnekt is an innovative library designed to help developers visualize connections and dependencies between files in their projects.

By offering a clear, interactive map of how your files are interconnected, CodNekt makes managing and optimizing your code base easier than ever.

Ideal for both small and large projects, making it a versatile tool for developers of various disciplines.

## Why should I use CodNekt?

In the vast expanse of the software universe, each line of code, like a star in the firmament, holds its place with purpose and connection.

Each function, class or component is a bright star, contributing its unique light to the models in our project.

In this celestial tapestry, the connections between the elements of the code are the invisible lines that draw the constellation together, defining its shape and telling its story.

Just as ancient astronomers used constellations to navigate the seas and understand the seasons, you can use your software architecture to navigate the complexity of your project and understand the relationships between its parts.

They highlight the invisible lines that connect the stars, revealing patterns that may not be immediately obvious.

- You will be able to see how individual parts contribute to the whole

- Identify areas that need improvement and ensure your code remains consistent and navigable, no matter how complex it becomes.

## Why Codnekt

The name derives from the union of the English words Code (code) and Connection (Connection). Playing with the letters and the assonance of the words themselves.
